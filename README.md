# Python_Homework

In this challenge, I was tasked with creating a Python script to analyze the financial records of a company and election data from a small, rural town who is modernizing its vote-counting process.  

Using the financial dataset, I created a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:
The total number of months included in the dataset

The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period




Using the election data, the goal was to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:

The total number of votes cast

A complete list of candidates who received votes

The percentage of votes each candidate won

The total number of votes each candidate won

The winner of the election based on popular vote
